["Answer Key: Logic & Critical Thinking\nMidterm Examination (Chapters 1 & 2)\nPrepared for: Sumeya Abdellah\nPart I: Multiple Choice Questions (60 pts)\nNo. Ans Explanation Reference\n1 B Philosophy is constructive because it attempts to formulate ratio- Page 14\nnally defensible answers to fundamental questions.\n2 B \u201dSince\u201d is listed as a typical premise indicator word. Page 46\n3 C Raising fundamental questions about existence characterizes the Page 12-13\nSocratic sense of wonder/wisdom.\n4 B A valid argument is defined by the impossibility of having true Page 74\npremises and a false conclusion.\n5 C AppliedEthicsdealswithspecificmoralproblemslikecapitalpun- Page 29\nishment or abortion.\n6 B Predictions about the future based on past events are inductive Page 71\narguments.\n7 B Empiricism is the view that knowledge is obtained through the Page 23\nsenses.\n8 A \u201dBecause\u201d and \u201dfurthermore\u201d indicate the reasons; \u201dYou should Page 45\navoid...\u201d is the main point (conclusion).\n9 C Philosophy is dynamic and critical, not a set of static, authorita- Page 16\ntive, or final beliefs.\n10 B Even if premises are true, the conclusion (cats are dogs) is false; Page 76\nthis combination makes it Invalid.\n11 B Socrates emphasized critical self-examination of one\u2019s life and val- Page 31\nues.\n12 B Strengthmeansitisimprobable(notimpossible)fortheconclusion Page 79\nto be false if premises are true.\n13 A Ontology studies the nature of existence (matter vs spirit, reality Page 22\nvs appearance).\n14 B Non-argumentative passages (like advice or reports) lack an infer- Page 52\nential claim (reasoning process).\n15 A Philosophy helps develop one\u2019s own beliefs/worldview, leading to Page 32\nintellectual independence.\n16 A A sound argument must be valid AND have all true premises. Page 78\n17 B Philosophical wisdom is a critical habit and vigilance, not just Page 13\ntechnical expertise.\n18 B Theargumentappliesageneralrule(categorical)toaspecificcase; Page 69\nCategorical Syllogisms are deductive.\n19 B Meta-ethics investigates the meaning of ethical terms and sources Page 28\nof ethical principles.\n1", "Jimma University Answer Key & Explanations\nNo. Ans Explanation Reference\n20 B A statement must be a declarative sentence capable of being true Page 42\nor false.\n21 C Free will vs. determinism is a core question of the Anthropological Page 21\naspect of Metaphysics.\n22 A Argumentsbasedonpurearithmeticorgeometriccomputationare Page 69\ndeductive.\n23 B Russellstatedthevalueofphilosophyliesinitsuncertainty,freeing Page 33\nus from dogmatism.\n24 B The form is valid, but since the premises are false, it is Valid but Page 78\nUnsound.\n25 C Skepticism claims people cannot acquire reliable knowledge and Page 23\nthe search for truth is in vain.\n26 D Arguments from analogy (comparing similarities) are probabilistic Page 71\nand thus Inductive.\n27 C An argument requires a group of statements with at least one Page 43\npremise and one conclusion.\n28 C Intuitionisdirectapprehensionnotderivedfromconsciousreason- Page 25\ning or sense perception.\n29 B A cogent argument must be Strong AND have all true premises. Page 83\n30 C \u201dDoing\u201d philosophy involves reflecting on and criticizing deeply Page 15\nheld conceptions.\n31 A Arguments based on signs (visual cues) are Inductive. Page 71\n32 C QuestionsaboutgovernmentbelongtoSocial/PoliticalPhilosophy, Page 30\nnot Aesthetics.\n33 A In \u201dIf... then...\u201d, the first part is the Antecedent (if-clause). Page 59\n34 B The premise (Most people) provides probabilistic support, but the Page 81\nlink is weak given the context.\n35 B Metaphysics asks \u201dWhat is reality?\u201d vs \u201dWhat is appearance?\u201d. Page 20\n36 B Unlike validity (all or nothing), strength admits degrees (more or Page 81\nless probable).\n37 B A is the Antecedent, B is the Consequent. Page 59\n38 C A valid argument CAN have false premises (Unsound). It cannot Page 77\nhave T premises and F conclusion.\n39 B Logic studies the principles of right reasoning/arguments, not the Page 40\npsychological process.\n40 B To be Cogent, it must be Strong. If it is Weak, it is automatically Page 83\nUncogent.\n41 C An argument can exist without indicator words (implied infer- Page 47\nence); other options are mandatory.\n42 A Obligations to the State and laws are central to Social/Political Page 30\nPhilosophy.\n43 C Statistical arguments (99%) are inductive, and 99% is very high Page 71\nprobability, making it Strong.\n44 B \u201dNecessarily\u201d indicates the arguer claims the conclusion follows Page 67\nwith certainty (Deduction).\n45 C Having T premises and T conclusion implies nothing about the Page 76\nlink. It could be valid or invalid.\n46 B Explanations assume the event happened (fact) and give reasons Page 57\n*why*; Arguments try to prove *that* it is true.\nPage 2", "Jimma University Answer Key & Explanations\nNo. Ans Explanation Reference\n47 B Philosophy intensifies self-awareness by examining the intellectual Page 32\ngrounds of our lives.\n48 C Cogency requires the \u201dTotal Evidence Requirement\u201d (not sup- Page 83\npressing important facts).\n49 B Deductive arguments claim the conclusion follows with necessity Page 64\n(impossibility of falsehood).\n50 D Uncogent = Weak OR Strong with False Premises. So both B and Page 83\nC make it Uncogent.\n51 B Relying on the testimony of an expert/authority is an Inductive Page 71\nargument.\n52 B Inductive strength relies on the probabilistic support (content), Page 81\nnot just structure.\n53 A The form is Valid and the premises are actually True. Thus, it is Page 78\nSound.\n54 A Drawing a conclusion about the next instance based on past sam- Page 71\nples is Generalization (Inductive).\n55 B Soundness requires Validity. If it is Invalid, it cannot be Sound. Page 79\n56 B While not explicitly in the text, Apologetics historically defends Page 21\nreligious doctrine (Theological aspect).\n57 B Necessary reasoning (certainty) is the hallmark of Deduction. Page 64\n58 A Comparing Calculus to Physics based on similarity (Math require- Page 71\nment) is Analogy.\n59 B Validity deals with the link. If premises are false, it fails the truth Page 79\ncondition for Soundness.\n60 B Logic is the science that evaluates arguments (good vs bad reason- Page 39\ning).\nPart II: Fill in the Blank (15 pts)\n1.

Analogy (Page 71)\n15. Inferential (Page 49)\nPart III: Short Answer (15 pts)\n1. Metaphysics vs. Axiology: Metaphysics studies ultimate reality and existence (God, mind,\nmatter), while Axiology studies values (ethics/goodness and aesthetics/beauty). (Page 19/27)\n2. Benefits of Logic: 1) Skills to evaluate arguments, 2) Defense against propaganda/prejudice,\n3) Distinguishing good from bad reasoning. (Page 41)\n3. Conditional Statement: It is not an argument because it does not assert that the antecedent\nis true; it only claims a relationship (\u201dIf X, then Y\u201d), lacking a factual claim. (Page 60)\n4. Valid vs. Sound: AValidargumenthasacorrectstructure(conclusionfollowsfrompremises),\nwhereas a Sound argument is Valid AND has actually true premises. (Page 78)\n5. Argument vs. Illustration: An argument tries to prove *that* something is true; an illus-\ntration provides examples to show *how* something is done or what it means. (Page 56)\n6. Deduction vs. Induction: Deductiveargumentsclaimtheconclusionfollowswith*necessity*\n(certainty); Inductive arguments claim the conclusion follows with *probability*. (Page 64/65)\n7. Valid Deductive Ex: All humans are mortal. Sumeya is human. Therefore, Sumeya is mortal.\n(Page 65)\n8. Strong Inductive Ex: Most university students are hard workers. Sumeya is a university\nstudent. Therefore, Sumeya is probably a hard worker. (Page 66)\n9. True Premises/Conclusion but Invalid: Validity depends on the *link*. If the premises are\ntrue and conclusion is true, but the premises don\u2019t *cause* the conclusion (e.g., \u201dGrass is green.\nSugar is sweet.\u201d), it is invalid. (Page 76)\n10. Explanandum vs. Explanans: Explanandum is the event being explained (the fact); Ex-\nplanans is the statement doing the explaining (the reason). (Page 57)\n11. Skepticism: The epistemological position claiming that people cannot acquire reliable knowl-\nedge and that the search for truth is in vain. (Page 23)\n12. InferentialClaim: Theclaimthatthepassageexpressesareasoningprocess\u2014thatthepremises\nsupport or imply the conclusion. (Page 50)\n13. Empiricism vs. Rationalism: Empiricism claims knowledge comes from sense experience;\nRationalism claims knowledge comes from reason/thought. (Page 23/24)\n14. Reports: They convey information about a topic but do not claim that the statements support\nor imply a conclusion (no inferential claim). (Page 54)\n15. Weak Argument: It implies that even if the premises are assumed to be true, they do not\nmake the conclusion probable (the support is insufficient). (Page 81)\nPage 4"]
